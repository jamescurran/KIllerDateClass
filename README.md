# KillerDateClass
"The Killer Date Class!" Version 5.00   (open source code from 1993!)

This is a C++ Date class and is a very early example of "open-source" code being developed by multiple coders 
around the world who never met.   Version 3.1 (earliest release with a date, and first known to be collaborative) 
was release 3-Aug-1991, beating the first public announcement of Linux by three weeks.
